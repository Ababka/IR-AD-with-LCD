concerns- LCD wont read "IR Controls Online"
	 if it does i want it to stay on the top line the whole time
	- under void loop "lcd.clear()"  will that clear the screen? if so, can it be removed
	 to not clear screan from saying "IR Controls Online" the entire time?


--I want the second line to show whether "a button led on" or "d button led off"
	on code under void loop, under while statement, will "(Serial.available() > 0)"
	need to be changed to "(Serial.available() > 1)" to only print on the 2nd line?
